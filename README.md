# STEAM-Transit
## Inspiration
For most of my life, I have not traveled outside of my bubble, every once in a while I do. The most memorable memories of those times when I traveled past my comfort zone were when I visited such places. Such as museums, parks, and theaters. As well as historical attractions. When these trips were made available, and attainable to me, my child-like self was utterly stoked to put down everything and leave. I rarely ever travel, I have been confined to my imagination as to what visiting these places was like.
## What it does
It essentially shows the nearest buildings (within a TBD scope/range)which count as STEAM: Science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (e.g. art museums, research labs, history museums, historical recreational events ). I would like for it to also include college-supervised buildings, which are separate from the main college campus.

## What's next for STEAM Transit
Maybe launching a mobile app, If I am able to make the app in less than a day, then I would be glad to do so.
